  <h2>RESOURCES</h2>

<p>This section exists because I need it and not because anyone would ever comb through the depths of websites to find these resources.</p>
  <p>Anyway, study guides may be frequented by Bronx Science students and Iâ€™m guessing the exhaustive quiz by ts users. The public health section is for Facebook oldies but anyway. Hello, welcome.</p>
