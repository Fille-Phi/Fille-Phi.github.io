About Me:

Hi, I’m Sophie. I like to listen to music and read novels. My all-time favorites are Taylor Swift and the Charlie Thorne series by Stuart Gibbs. On a typical weekend, I’ll be gardening, coding, writing, and confusedly screaming at the latest machine learning papers.

Currently reading: Loveless
Currently listening to: Becky’s So Hot

CHEMISTRY

My life’s work is in chemistry. I have here attempted to begin an indexing of the chemical information in my brain and share it with this little corner of the internet. I believe it is important for everyone to have access to these little nuggets of information, whether for the precocious boy or middle-aged mother.

My special wish is for this to reach the little girl like me, who may not have the opportunities, resources, or confidence to succeed in chemistry.

Throughout my education and work in STEM fields, I’ve seen the amount of girls plummet as they grow. Scraping standardized test data, everyone starts with statistically insignificant proficiency in mathematics and science. Starting in high school, girls begin to fail; selective schools, math teams, and olympiad programs start having ratios like 2:3, 1:2, and even 1:3 (of girls to boys). Engineering departments of universities will have a maximum of one third girls. In graduate and post-graduate labs, girls are conspicuously absent. In one group I worked with, I was the only girl working with nine men, with the exception of a lab technician.


RESOURCES

This section exists because I need it and not because anyone would ever comb through the depths of websites to find these resources. Anyway, study guides may be frequented by Bronx Science students and I’m guessing the exhaustive quiz by ts users. The public health section is for Facebook oldies but anyway. Hello, welcome.
